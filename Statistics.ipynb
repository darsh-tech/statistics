    "In Machine Learning, understanding your data is crucial before feeding it into models. Descriptive statistics help you get a sense of the data.\r\n",

    "These help summarize the center of your data, providing insight into typical values.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Mean**: The average of all data points.\r\n",
    "- **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted in ascending order.\r\n",
    "- **Mode**: The most frequent value in the dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Measures of Dispersion: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range\r\n",
    "These show how spread out your data is, which is vital for understanding model stability.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Variance**: Measures the spread of data points from the mean.\r\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, indicating how much data deviates from the mean.\r\n",
    "- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Why is it important for Machine Learning?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Helps you understand the distribution and characteristics of data before applying algorithms.\r\n",
    "- Identifies potential problems like outliers and skewed distributions, which can affect models like linear regression.\r\n"
